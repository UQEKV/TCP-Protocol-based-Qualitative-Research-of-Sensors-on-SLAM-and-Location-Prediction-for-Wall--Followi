# TCP-Protocol-based-Qualitative-Research-of-Sensors-on-SLAM-and-Location-Prediction-for-Wall--Followi

Abstractâ€”This article investigates the measured variables from different sensors influencing the performances of the wall following based on the Bang-bang controller's performances as a baseline and PID controller as improvement methods to map a kitchen area. The result shows that encoder is more precise for mapping because the IMU data is not reliable enough. Moreover, the approach based on Bang-bang controller is more robust while the PID based method can achieve local optimum at the most time.
